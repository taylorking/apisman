# APIs Man! 
### What this is
This is me trying to make a little C++ program to generate simple backend programs to manage APIS defined in swagger. I saw [crow](https://github.com/ipkn/crow) and got carried away.

### Features
Planned features for this project:
- C++ crow code generated for CRUD actions on your API
- MySQL Database integration 
- APIs defined in swagger
